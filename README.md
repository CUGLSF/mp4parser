This is a tiny tool to parse a mp4 file.
## Build
```bash
$ go build
````
## Usage
```bash
$./mp4parser -f mp4_file -v
```
## Goal
To implement a tool that supports MP4/FLV/TS and other common file formats with a GUI.

Although we have ffmprobe and other opensource tools, we still need one sharp tool to do format analysing.
